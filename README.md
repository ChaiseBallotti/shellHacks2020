# shellHacks2020
This is a website that ask user for interest in art genres and displays galleries they might enjoy
This was everyone's first time at a hackathon. There were two people that went MIA, causing the project to crumble. 
I took this as an opertunity to learn project guidance and leadership. I needed to check in on where my individual team members were with their code. 
I also could have been more consice with my intructions and left a little more time in the begainning to brainstorm.

This was a good time for me to learn and practice my HTML and CSS skills. I will take the things that I learned and apply them to my personal website and 
other websites that I will create in the future.
